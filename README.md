# leetcode-solutions

## Purpose

I realized that though I felt I had a strong understanding of computer science,
I still performed inconsistently on common algorithms interview questions. This
led me to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), a site that lists a few hundred
problems and has you implement their solutions in the language of your choice.
Since the vast majority of the time I would write my responses to these
questions in Python, I decided to make a repository for my solutions!

Note that these problems are the intellectual property of Leetcode. I make
no claim of copyright nor any guarantees that this repository will stay up.
It's purely for educational purposes and each problem links back to its
corresponding Leetcode page.

If you would like to do this, too, please fork my repository that contains
blank solutions [here](https://github.com/cfoust/leetcode-problems).
