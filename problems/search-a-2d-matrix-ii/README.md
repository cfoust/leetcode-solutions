# Search a 2D Matrix II
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/description)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an _m_ x _n_ matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:

  * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
  * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Consider the following matrix:

    
    
    [
      [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
      [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
      [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
      [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
      [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
    ]
    

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** matrix, target = 5
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** matrix, target = 20
    **Output:** false
