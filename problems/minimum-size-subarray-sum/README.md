# Minimum Size Subarray Sum
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description)

Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s** , find
the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum  â‰¥ **s**. If
there isn 't one, return 0 instead.

**Example:  **

    
    
    **Input:** [2,3,1,2,4,3], s = 7
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the _O_ ( _n_ ) solution, try coding another solution
of which the time complexity is _O_ ( _n_ log _n_ ).
