# Partition List
[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/description)

Given a linked list and a value _x_ , partition it such that all nodes less
than _x_ come before nodes greater than or equal to _x_.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
two partitions.

**Example:**

    
    
    **Input:** head = 1- >4->3->2->5->2, _x_ = 3
    **Output:** 1- >2->2->4->3->5
