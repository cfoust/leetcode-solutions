[Leetcode page](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-iii/description)

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices
_i_ and _j_ in the array such that the **absolute** difference between
**nums[i]** and **nums[j]** is at most _t_ and the **absolute** difference
between _i_ and _j_ is at most _k_.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,2,3,1], _k_ = 4, t = 0
    **Output:** true

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,0,1,1], _k_ = __ 1, t = 0
    **Output:** true

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** [4,2], _k_ = __ 2, t = 1 
    **Output:** false
